# Hello, I'm Fahri Putra! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data enthusiast with a strong passion for exploring and visualizing data. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I share my journey of discovering insights and patterns through data analysis.

## Introduction

My fascination with data has led me to dive deep into various datasets, uncovering stories and trends that are hidden within the numbers. I believe that data has the power to transform information into knowledge and drive informed decision-making.

## Exploring Data

- **Data Analysis**: I enjoy digging into datasets, cleaning and structuring data for meaningful exploration.
- **Data Visualization**: I create interactive visualizations to communicate insights and engage with the audience.
- **Curiosity-Driven**: I'm constantly seeking new datasets to analyze and unique ways to present information.

## Tools and Techniques

Here are some of the tools and techniques I use to unravel the world of data:

- Data Manipulation: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
- Keras,SKLearn,TF for ML Modelling
